# Snake-Ladders-with-javafx
This was an assignment from a java course, we were tasked to make a snake and ladders game that ran in 
console using keyboard inputs. After making that, I found the gameplay experience terrible so I decided
to remake the project with real graphics and game buttons. Other than having to instantiate the amount of 
players in console, this feels more like a game someone other than a programmer would play.
