# Snake-Ladders-with-javafx
This was an assignment from a java course, we were tasked to make a snake and ladders game that ran in 
console using keyboard inputs. After making that, I found the gameplay experience terrible so I decided
to remake the project with real graphics and game buttons. Other than having to instantiate the amount of 
players in console, this feels more like a game someone other than a programmer would play.
A typical game start message looks like so:


-------------------------------------------------
           Welcome to Snake and Ladder!
-------------------------------------------------


-> First, enter number of players: 2

-> 2 players will be created shortly
The playing turn will be randomized on game start

Once the game board renders, a wall of text will be printed to console, it might appear in random places, most commonly, it is behind the IDE.
